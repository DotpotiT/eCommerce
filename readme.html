## Installation

To install this website on your local machine, you need to have XAMPP installed and running. You can download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.

Follow these steps to install the website:

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to your `xampp/htdocs` directory.
2. Create a new database in phpMyAdmin and import the `ecommerce.sql` file from the repository.
3. Edit the `wp-config.php` file in the root directory and change the database name, username, and password to match your settings.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/ecommerce` to view the website.
5. To access the WordPress dashboard, go to `http://localhost/ecommerce/wp-admin` and log in with the username `admin` and the password `admin`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the website, you can try the following solutions:

- If XAMPP can't open MySQL, you may need to delete the file `C:\xampp\mysql\data\aria_log_control` and restart XAMPP.
- If you see an error message about permalinks, you may need to update the `.htaccess` file in the root directory. Go to WordPress dashboard > Settings > Permalinks and click Save Changes.
- If you see broken images or links, you may need to update the site URL. Go to WordPress dashboard > Settings > General and change the WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) to `http://localhost/ecommerce`.
